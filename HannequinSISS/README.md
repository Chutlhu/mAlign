## Setup

Follow the instruction below :
* clone the git repository on your hard drive
* open matlab and cd to the directory where you cloned the repository
* run setup.m (if asked, click on "add to path")

You should then be able to use any functions or scripts in this directory.
You can test the code using the script script_SISS.m (might take a little while)
